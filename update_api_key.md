# API Key Update Instructions

To run the application in production mode with real API calls, you need to update your `.env` file with a valid OpenAI API key.

1. Open your `.env` file
2. Update the `OPENAI_API_KEY` line with your valid API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_api_key_here
   ```
3. Save the file
4. Restart the application

Note: Your current API key appears to be invalid or improperly formatted. OpenAI API keys typically start with `sk-` followed by a long string of characters.
